# AI Collaboration Reflection

## What worked well with AI

**Your most successful AI interaction:**

``` text
My conversation about design philosophy went really well with AI. From that response I was able to ask questions about my design layout, fonts, colors, etc. I learned that being descriptive and asking the right questions will make AI responses more effective. A lot of the times you can get precise with it if you just add more information and ask for explanation.
```

**How your prompting improved:**

``` text
My first AI converstation was very straight and to the point which I feel like isn't always the best approach for every scenario. Sometimes breaking down your prompts into sections gets better responses which is what I did. I followed the sample prompts plus asked for clarification and explanations along the way. I also would compare responses for a more precise output by the end of the conversation. 
```

**AI's best contributions:**

``` text
I think AI is best with technical guidance but for design you really have to play around with it to get exactly what you're trying to envision. 
```

## Learning from limitations

**One thing AI got wrong or missed:**

``` text
Recommended Typography Pairing: Playfair Display (headings) + Lora (body/poem)

Why it fits your poem and design philosophy:
Playfair Display (headings):
Elegant and literary, evokes the sophistication of classic poetry.
Perfect for your poem title and section headings without feeling heavy or formal.
Subtle contrast and high x-height make it readable at different sizes.

Lora (body/poem lines):
A highly readable serif font with moderate contrast, ideal for medium-length lines.
Gentle curves complement the serenity and natural imagery of the poem.
Supports generous line-height for spacious stanzas, reinforcing the contemplative mood.

Technical advantages:

Both are Google Fonts, ensuring reliable cross-browser support.
Supports WCAG AA contrast requirements with proper text/background colors.
Works well with responsive scaling (clamp() or rem) and maintains harmony across mobile and desktop.
Elegant pairing: Playfair’s decorative qualities contrast nicely with Lora’s understated readability.

Usage:
Headings (h1, h2) → Playfair Display, larger font, possibly semi-bold.
Poem lines (p, .line) → Lora, normal weight, line-height 1.6–1.8.

Author attribution → Lora italic or smaller size to differentiate subtly.


Although the AI response is really detailed. In reality, the two fonts are way too similar to each other and they are two subtle to notice a difference. I'm not necessarily saying that the response was entirely wrong but the difference was way too subtle for an average person to pick up.
```

**Your workaround strategy:**

``` text
I compared other fonts to the one in the response and was able to find ones that had a minimal but clear difference because that is the style I was going for. 
```

**Advice for other students:**

``` text
I would advise other students to not rely on the initial response and to keep asking with more prompts to narrow down specific design and structure needs. A lot of the time AI is not giving the most reliable information so it's best to take the response and do some research on it as well. The responses should be an idea added to your brainstorming and not a template for what you want to create. AI is a powerful tool to help aid with breaking down and automating ideas, however, we shouldn't rely on it entirely.

```

## Ready for implementation?

**Are you prepared to start coding your poetry website?** Yes

**Why or why not?**

``` text
I feel confident to start the poetry project and will learn along as I go. 
```

**How will you use AI in the main Poetry project?**

``` text
I will use AI to ensure I'm using the right structure for the project as sometimes a small mistake can mess everything around with the styling later. I will also use AI to get more ideas to enhance my project if needed. 
```

**Most important lesson learned:**

``` text
Again, I learned that you cannot soley rely on AI for everything. It's a powerful tool that can aid in the development process but it isn't always producing outputs that are polished and organic. 
```

**Public domain verification:**

``` text
My poem of choice is public domain, the author died in 1939 (86 years ago).
```
